# ros-gazebo-example
A navigation example of a robot sweeping through an environmnet

# Installation

We will be using the turtle bot as our working example robot. First you will have to install the ros packages 
for the turtle bot. These packages depend on gazebo2 which is the default provided when you install indo-full-desktop.
If you want to use a more recent version of gazebo you will have to build the turtlebot packages from source.

	
```css
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-*
```
